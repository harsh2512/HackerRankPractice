/*
You have a record of  students. Each record contains the student's name, and their percent marks in Maths, Physics and Chemistry. The marks can be floating values. The user enters some integer  followed by the names and marks for students. You are required to save the record in a dictionary data type. The user then enters a student's name. Output the average percentage marks obtained by that student, correct to two decimal places.

Input Format

The first line contains the integer , the number of students. The next  lines contains the name and marks obtained by that student separated by a space. The final line contains the name of a particular student previously listed.

Constraints
2 <= N <= 10
0 <= Marks <= 100

Output Format

Print one line: The average of the marks obtained by the particular student correct to 2 decimal places.

/*
Students of District College have a subscription to English and French newspapers. Some students have subscribed to only the English newspaper, some have subscribed to only the French newspaper, and some have subscribed to both newspapers.

You are given two sets of student roll numbers. One set has subscribed to the English newspaper, and one set has subscribed to the French newspaper. Your task is to find the total number of students who have subscribed to only English newspapers.

.difference()
The tool .difference() returns a set with all the elements from the set that are not in an iterable.
Sometimes the - operator is used in place of the .difference() tool, but it only operates on the set of elements in set.
Set is immutable to the .difference() operation (or the - operation).

>>> s = set("Hacker")
>>> print s.difference("Rank")
set(['c', 'r', 'e', 'H'])

>>> print s.difference(set(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k']))
set(['c', 'r', 'e', 'H'])

>>> print s.difference(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k'])
set(['c', 'r', 'e', 'H'])

>>> print s.difference(enumerate(['R', 'a', 'n', 'k']))
set(['a', 'c', 'r', 'e', 'H', 'k'])

>>> print s.difference({"Rank":1})
set(['a', 'c', 'e', 'H', 'k', 'r'])

>>> s - set("Rank")
set(['H', 'c', 'r', 'e'])

The first line contains the number of students who have subscribed to the English newspaper. 
The second line contains the space separated list of student roll numbers who have subscribed to the English newspaper.
The third line contains the number of students who have subscribed to the French newspaper. 
The fourth line contains the space separated list of student roll numbers who have subscribed to the French newspaper.

Output Format

Output the total number of students who are subscribed to the English newspaper only.
